*Resolved* - Power has been restored, and all services are back online. {{< track "2023-04-05 21:33:00" >}}

*Monitoring* - A power outage caused my main server to be shut down. No user data was lost. I will reactivate all services once power has been restored. There is currently no ETA on power restoration. {{< track "2023-04-05 21:14:00" >}}
